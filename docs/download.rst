``Antares`` allows automated data download from various sources like SciHub, Usgs or Espa.

See for instance the ``create_order`` and ``download_order`` command lines that allow a user to order on demand surface reflectance preprocessing of Landsat data and retrieve the data once its been processed by the espa system.
