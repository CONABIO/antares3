License Grant:

The package contains software ("Software") and related explanatory written materials ("Documentation").

"We" and "us" means Berkeley Environmental Technology International, LLC.

We hereby grant you a nonexclusive license to use one copy of the Software on any single computer, provided the Software is in use on only one computer at any time. The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (RAM) or installed into the permanent memory of a computer—for example, a hard disk, CD-ROM or other storage device.

If the Software is permanently installed on the hard disk or other storage device of a computer (other than a network server) and one person uses that computer more than 80% of the time, then that person may also use the Software on a portable or home computer.

This end user license agreement may be amended by the purchase of a "Site License".
